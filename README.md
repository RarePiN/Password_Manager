# Password_Manager
<p>
This is a project that I created for my personal usage. <br>
I am not good at coding by any means. <br>
So please note that this password manager is not safe to use. <br>
I share it mainly for self access and educational purpose. <br>

# To-Do:
<p>
1: Decrypt password from file <br>
2: Finish output password function <br>
3: Add access with password only <br>
4: Finish user interface <br>
</p>
